## Food App

## Overview

The Food App is a simple and elegant mobile application built using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture. This app allows users to browse popular food categories, save their favorite items, search for specific dishes, and manage their saved list. The app provides a seamless user experience with features like undo functionality and a modern design.

## Features

• Home Page: Displays popular food items in a visually appealing ViewPager.

• Saved Page: Keeps track of favorite food items saved by the user.

• Category Page: Shows food categories for easy navigation.

• Search Page: Enables users to search for food items. Swiping a food item removes it from the saved list with an option to undo within a few seconds.

## Tech Stack

• Kotlin: Programming language for Android development.

• MVVM Architecture: Ensures a clear separation of concerns and maintains a scalable structure.

• Room Database: Used for local storage of saved food items.

• Retrofit: Handles network requests to fetch food data from APIs.

• Navigation Component: Manages navigation and ensures smooth transitions between app fragments.

• Coroutines: Simplifies asynchronous programming and enhances app performance.

• LiveData: Ensures UI updates are responsive to data changes.
